# Gauntlet Testing Strategy

## Overview and Philosophy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `applydiff` core patching engine. The strategy is built upon a philosophy of **evidence-based confidence**. A simple "pass" is insufficient for a mission-critical tool; we require verifiable proof of not only the correctness of the final output but also the efficiency and correctness of the internal process.

Our testing framework, orchestrated by `gauntlet.rs`, has evolved from a simple black-box verifier to a sophisticated **white-box testing harness**. It achieves this through:

1.  **Test Case Isolation:** Each test case is a self-contained directory (`tests/<CASE_ID>/`) with explicit `before` and `after` states.
2.  **Sandbox Execution:** All tests run in a temporary, isolated sandbox environment, ensuring no side effects and a clean state for every run.
3.  **Instrumentation & Log Capture:** The application's core components (e.g., `Logger`, `matcher`) are instrumented to emit detailed logs about their internal decision-making. The test harness captures this output for verification.
4.  **Metadata-Driven Verification:** Each test is defined by a `meta.json` file that specifies not just the expected outcome, but also internal behavioral and performance criteria.

This approach allows us to move from assumption to proof, providing a 10/10 confidence level in the components under test.

## Completed Test Cases

### LF01: Large File Patch at Start

*   **Objective:** To verify the correct and **performant** application of an exact-match patch (`fuzz=1.0`) targeting the first line of a large (50,000-line, multi-megabyte) text file.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  A 50,000-line `large_file.txt` was programmatically generated for the `before` state.
    2.  A corresponding `after` state file was generated with the first line modified.
    3.  A `patch.txt` file was created to transform the `before` state to the `after` state.
    4.  The `meta.json` was configured to expect 1 successful block application and 0 failures. Critically, it was also configured to require proof of the internal execution path.

*   **Verification Points:**
    1.  **Output State Verification (Black-Box):** The orchestrator performed a byte-for-byte comparison between the file produced in the sandbox and the `tests/LF01-Replace-Start/after/large_file.txt`. The test passed this check, confirming the final output was bit-perfect.
    2.  **Execution Outcome Verification (Black-Box):** The application's report of `ok=1, fail=0` was compared against the `meta.json` expectation. The test passed this check, confirming the application correctly reported its own success.
    3.  **Internal Behavior Verification (White-Box):** This was the essential check for 10/10 confidence.
        *   **Instrumentation:** The `matcher::find_best_match` function was instrumented to log which internal code path was executed: the `O(1)` exact-string search (`haystack.find()`) or the `O(n*m)` line-by-line fuzzy search.
        *   **Proof:** The `meta.json` included the directive `"expected_log_contains": "\"action\":\"fast_path_match\""`.
        *   **Result:** The test orchestrator captured the application's structured logs and verified the presence of this exact string.

*   **Confidence Analysis (10/10):**
    The confidence in this test result is absolute. We have not only proven that the application can produce the correct output for this scenario, but we have **irrefutable proof** that it did so using the most efficient and correct internal algorithm. By verifying the "fast_path_match" log, we eliminate the assumption that the tool might have wastefully performed a full fuzzy scan. We have validated the "what" (the output) and, crucially, the "how" (the process).

## Test Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the future test cases required to achieve comprehensive coverage of the patching engine. Tests will be developed and validated one at a time.

### Category 1: Large File & Performance (`LF` Series)
*Goal: Ensure stability and performance with large file inputs.*

*   **`LF02-Replace-Middle`**: Verifies correct patch application in the middle of a large file, forcing the matcher to seek.
*   **`LF03-Replace-End`**: Verifies correct patch application at the end of a large file.
*   **`LF04-Multi-Line-Replace`**: Verifies matching and replacement of a large, multi-line chunk within a large file.
*   **`LF05-Fuzzy-No-Match`**: Verifies that a fuzzy search across a large file terminates gracefully and within a performance budget when no suitable match is found.

### Category 2: Matcher & Applier Robustness (`MA` Series)
*Goal: Stress the fuzzy matching algorithm and newline handling logic.*

*   **`MA01-True-Ambiguity`**: Verifies that the patcher fails when a fuzzy search finds multiple equally-scored best matches.
*   **`MA02-Sequential-Dependency`**: Verifies that for a multi-block patch on a single file, a later block correctly fails if its context was removed by an earlier block.
*   **`MA03-CRLF-to-LF-Harmonization`**: Verifies that a patch with LF line endings correctly harmonizes its output to match a file with CRLF line endings.
*   **`MA04-Delete-No-EOL`**: Verifies correct deletion of the final line of a file that lacks a trailing newline.
*   **`MA05-Append-No-EOL`**: Verifies correct appending of content to a file that lacks a trailing newline.

### Category 3: Filesystem & Edge Cases (`FS` Series)
*Goal: Ensure resilience against filesystem errors and unusual file states.*

*   **`FS01-Create-Subdirectory`**: Verifies that the applier correctly creates parent directories for a patch targeting a file path that does not yet exist.
*   **`FS02-Empty-File-Patch`**: Verifies the correct application of a patch to a zero-byte file.
*   **`FS03-Binary-File`**: Verifies that attempting to patch a non-UTF8 binary file results in a graceful read failure, leaving the original file untouched.
*   **`FS04-Read-Only-File`**: Verifies that attempting to apply a patch to a read-only file results in a graceful write failure.
