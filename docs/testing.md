# ApplyDiff – Gauntlet & Lab Testing

> Evidence-first confidence, not vibes. We verify both the **what** (output) and the **how** (internal path).

## Philosophy

The patcher is safety-critical. Tests must prove:
- Correct final state (byte-for-byte where applicable)
- Correct internal behavior (fast/slow path, thresholds, safety guards)
- Clear, structured observability so failures teach us something

We enforce this with:
- **Isolation:** Every case runs in a temp sandbox
- **Determinism:** Fixtures under `tests/<CASE_ID>/` or generated programmatically
- **Instrumentation:** Structured JSONL logs from subsystems (`matcher`, `applier`)
- **Metadata:** `meta.json` specifies expected counts + log breadcrumbs
- **Multi-layer verification:** Hash comparison, byte-level analysis, metadata checks

## Current Test Coverage

**Automated gauntlet: 8/8 passing ✅**

### 01-afb-append – AFB-1 Append/Create ✅
**What:** Armored format creates new file with parent directories  
**Verifies:**
- Base64 decoding works correctly
- Empty FROM triggers create/append logic
- Parent directories auto-created

### 02-afb-replace – AFB-1 Exact Replace ✅
**What:** Armored format replaces exact match  
**Verifies:**
- Base64 encoding/decoding round-trip
- Exact match detection in armored format
- Proper content replacement

### 03-path-traversal – Path Escape Rejection ✅
**What:** Patch attempts `../escape.txt`  
**Verifies:**
- Path validation rejects `..` components
- No files written outside sandbox
- `ok=0, fail=1` counts

### 04-append-create – Empty FROM Creates File ✅
**What:** Classic format with empty FROM creates deep nested file  
**Verifies:**
- Empty FROM triggers create logic
- Parent directories auto-created
- File created with correct content

### 05-large-file – 50K Line Fast Path ✅
**What:** Exact-match edit at line 1 of 50K-line file  
**Verifies:**
- Byte-for-byte output correctness
- Fast path used (`"action":"fast_path_match"` in logs)
- Performance: completes in <1 second

### 06-ambiguity-simple – Duplicate YAML Blocks ✅
**What:** Patch matches two identical 3-line YAML blocks  
**Verifies:**
- Ambiguity detection triggers
- Patch rejected (`ok=0, fail=1`)
- Log contains `"ambiguous_match"` breadcrumb

### 07-ambiguity-indent – Similar Python Functions ✅
**What:** Patch matches two functions with identical content  
**Verifies:**
- Ambiguity detection across different formatting
- Rejection even with whitespace variance
- Log contains `"ambiguous_match"`

### 08-crlf-preserve – Byte-Level Line Ending Preservation ✅
**What:** Four files test CRLF/LF preservation and harmonization  
**Verifies (UNDENIABLE PROOF):**
- **Binary verification:** Counts exact `0x0D 0x0A` (CRLF) vs `0x0A` (LF) sequences
- **windows.txt:** 3 CRLF, 0 solo LF → pure Windows preservation
- **unix.txt:** 0 CRLF, 3 solo LF → pure Unix preservation  
- **mixed.txt:** 2 CRLF, 1 solo LF → per-line preservation
- **harmonize.txt:** 3 CRLF → patch adopts file's line ending style
- **4 proof layers:** Binary count + byte-for-byte comparison + hexdump + SHA256

**Why this test is undeniable:**
1. Reads raw bytes (`fs::read`), no text API normalization
2. Counts exact byte sequences (0x0D 0x0A), mathematically verifiable
3. Four independent verification methods must all pass
4. If CRLF preservation were broken, at least one layer would fail

## Manual Lab (Quick Smoke Tests)

Create test environment:

```bash
TEST_DIR="$HOME/ApplyDiffLab"
rm -rf "$TEST_DIR"
mkdir -p "$TEST_DIR/src" "$TEST_DIR/docs" "$TEST_DIR/notes" "$TEST_DIR/new/nested"

# LF file
cat > "$TEST_DIR/readme.md" <<'EOF'
# ApplyDiff Lab
Welcome to the lab.
EOF

# CRLF file (Windows line endings)
printf 'function greet(){\r\n  console.log("Hello world");\r\n}\r\n' > "$TEST_DIR/src/app.js"

# Additional LF files
cat > "$TEST_DIR/src/math.js" <<'EOF'
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
EOF

cat > "$TEST_DIR/docs/guide.md" <<'EOF'
## Guide
Steps go here.
EOF

# Ambiguity test file
cat > "$TEST_DIR/notes/duplicate.txt" <<'EOF'
id: A
start
  marker: section
  value: target
end

id: B
start
  marker: section
  value: target
end
EOF

echo "Lab created at $TEST_DIR"
```

Open ApplyDiff → **Select Directory** → `~/ApplyDiffLab` → Paste test patches.

### Scenario A: Exact Match (Sanity Check)

```
>>> file: readme.md | fuzz=1.0
--- from
# ApplyDiff Lab
--- to
# ApplyDiff Lab (patched)
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- Green diff in preview
- "Apply Patch" button appears
- After apply: v1 tab appears, file updated

**Verify:** `cat ~/ApplyDiffLab/readme.md` shows `# ApplyDiff Lab (patched)`

### Scenario B: CRLF Preservation

```
>>> file: src/app.js | fuzz=0.85
--- from
  console.log("Hello world");
--- to
  console.log("Hello brave new world");
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- Diff shows single line change
- File keeps CRLF endings (`\r\n`)

**Verify:** `xxd -g 1 ~/ApplyDiffLab/src/app.js | grep -A1 "Hello"` shows `0d 0a` bytes

### Scenario C: Append-Create (New File)

```
>>> file: new/nested/log.txt | fuzz=1.0
--- from
--- to
Log started
Entry: 1
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- Diff shows "new file" with added lines
- Parent directories created automatically

**Verify:** `cat ~/ApplyDiffLab/new/nested/log.txt` shows both lines

### Scenario D: Path Traversal Rejection

```
>>> file: ../escape.txt | fuzz=1.0
--- from
--- to
You should never see this.
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- Console shows ❌ "Patch path escapes target directory"
- No "Apply Patch" button (or orange "Apply Valid Changes" if mixed with valid blocks)

### Scenario E: Ambiguity Trap

```
>>> file: notes/duplicate.txt | fuzz=0.90
--- from
start
    marker: section
    value: target
end
--- to
start
    marker: section
    value: PATCHED
end
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- No match ≥ 0.90 (two equally-good targets)
- Console shows ❌ with ambiguity mention
- Terminal logs show `"ambiguous_match"`

**Fix:** Add `id: A` to FROM block to disambiguate.

### Scenario F: Partial Apply (Mixed Results)

```
>>> file: readme.md | fuzz=1.0
--- from
Welcome to the lab.
--- to
Welcome to the patched lab.
<<<

>>> file: new/report.txt | fuzz=1.0
--- from
--- to
Report v1
<<<

>>> file: ../should-not-write.txt | fuzz=1.0
--- from
--- to
nope
<<<
```

**Expected:**
- Diff shows first two changes only
- Button reads "Apply Valid Changes" (orange)
- Console shows `2 applied, 1 failed`

**Verify:** `report.txt` created, `escape.txt` not created

## White-Box Log Probes

Tests verify these structured log entries:

| Subsystem | Action | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `matcher` | `fast_path_match` | Exact substring used (optimal) |
| `matcher` | `search_start` | Entering layered fuzzy search |
| `matcher` | `ambiguous_match` | Two+ targets with similar scores |
| `matcher` | `no_match_threshold` | Best score below `fuzz` setting |
| `applier` | (path escape message) | Path validation rejected block |

Example log entry:
```json
{"ts":"2025-10-20T07:30:03Z","level":"info","rid":1760945133803,"subsystem":"matcher","action":"fast_path_match","msg":"unique exact substring (len=38)"}
```

## Test Design Principles (Lessons from CRLF Test)

### Multi-Layer Verification
Every test should verify correctness at multiple independent levels:
1. **Expected output** (file contents match)
2. **Binary/byte-level** (for format-sensitive tests)
3. **Metadata** (filesystem state: mtime, size, permissions)
4. **Cryptographic proof** (SHA256 hashes where applicable)

### Making Tests Undeniable
A test is "undeniable" when passing proves correctness **by virtue of mathematical impossibility of faking**:

**Example: CRLF test**
- Can't fake SHA256 collision (cryptographically impossible)
- Can't fake byte sequence counts without actual preservation
- Can't pass all 4 layers without correct behavior

**Future tests should aim for this standard.**

## Running Tests

**Automated gauntlet:**
```bash
cargo tauri dev
# Click "Run Self-Test" in console
```

**Manual lab:**
1. Create `~/ApplyDiffLab` (see above)
2. Run scenarios A-F
3. Verify outputs match expectations
4. Check console logs for breadcrumbs

**Adding new tests:**
1. Create `tests/<NN>-<name>/{before/,after/,meta.json,patch.txt}`
2. `meta.json` must specify `expect_ok`, `expect_fail`
3. For binary tests, add verification to `test_runner.rs`
4. Run gauntlet, verify pass/fail
5. Commit test case with descriptive name

---

## Known Test Gaps

1. **Mixed success/fail**: Partial apply atomicity (Test #9 planned)
2. **Backup/restore**: Round-trip verification (Test #10 planned)
3. **Symlink escape**: Canonicalization checks (Test #11 planned)
4. **Performance bounds**: Worst-case fuzzy timing (Test #15 planned)
5. **Concurrent applies**: Rapid successive patches
6. **Version history persistence**: Versions survive restart

---

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: 8/15 tests, 12 subsystem behaviors verified
- **Confidence**: High for exact matching, ambiguity, CRLF, path safety
- **Gaps**: Atomicity, backups, symlinks, performance bounds
- **False positives**: None observed (all passes are legitimate)
- **False negatives**: Low risk (multi-layer verification)

**Current status: 53% complete (8/15)**  
**Target for v1.0:** 15/15 gauntlet tests passing
