This is a fantastic moment in the project. Based on the **ApplyDiff Intelligent Development Environment Roadmap** and the fact that the **Gauntlet Test Suite is now 14/14 PASSING**, we have successfully completed or established the foundation for the entirety of **Phases 0 and 1**, and completed the most complex, blocking features of **Phase 2**.

We are now officially in the transition between **v0.2.0** (Core Resilience Logic) and **v0.3.0** (Proactive Guidance & Automation), with the critical prerequisite tests for drift detection and context delivery (A, B, and C tests) fully satisfied.

## ApplyDiff Technical Roadmap Status

### PHASE 0 — Format Compatibility & Saccade State Ingestion (IPC Foundation)

| Feature / Task | Status | Details & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0.1 & 0.2: Implement Parsers (Whole File, Regex)** | **✅ COMPLETE** | Both `Whole File Parser` (`mode=replace`) and `Regex Replace Parser` (`mode=regex`) are functional and pass tests `a1` and `a2`. |
| **0.3: Initialize State & Ingest Keystone** | **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** | The function `init_session_logic` correctly runs Saccade (`SaccadePack::new(...).generate()`), initializes the session file (`.applydiff_session.json`), and tracks all files with `original_hash`. **Remaining Gap:** The logic required to *read* the Saccade `PACK.txt` output and specifically identify/persist **Keystone files** into `session.keystone_files` is not yet visible in `init_session_logic`. |

### PHASE 1 — Core Resilience Logic & State Persistence (v0.2.0)

| Feature / Task | Status | Details & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1: Session State Definition & I/O** | **✅ COMPLETE** | The `SessionState` struct (tracking `total_errors`, `exchange_count`, `file_metrics`) is defined and the I/O functions (`save_session_state`) are implemented. |
| **1.2: Prediction Error (PE) Tracking** | **✅ COMPLETE** | `apply_patch_logic` successfully detects application failures (`ErrorCode::NoMatch`, `ErrorCode::AmbiguousMatch`) and **automatically increments `session.total_errors`**. Verified by passing tests `b1` and `b2`. |
| **1.3: File Metric Tracking** | **✅ COMPLETE** | On successful application, `apply_patch_logic` increments `patch_count`. The `exchange_count` is also incremented by the test runner (implicitly via `apply_patch_logic` calling `save_session_state` and reading state in `b3`). |

### PHASE 2 — Proactive Guidance & Workflow Automation (v0.3.0)

This phase is **substantially complete**, having addressed the core user pain point (`HATE is clicking and pasting and clicking and fucking pasting`) and establishing the mandatory maintenance cycles.

#### 2.A. Context Request Automation (Instant Clipboard Workflow)

| Feature / Task | Status | Details & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.A.1: Implement `resolve_file_request` IPC** | **✅ COMPLETE** | The `resolve_file_request_logic` function parses complex YAML requests (including `path`, `reason`, and `range: lines/symbol`) and delegates to `saccade-core` for surgical slicing. This is verified by passing tests `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`. |
| **2.A.2: Wire File Request Automation** | **✅ COMPLETE** | The frontend (`tauri-bridge.js`) correctly intercepts the `REQUEST_FILE:` protocol via clipboard input, triggers the `resolve_file_request` IPC, and **instantly copies the resolved Markdown output back to the clipboard**. This fully automates the file retrieval flow, eliminating the manual clicking and pasting step. |

#### 2.B. Proactive Guidance and Error Enforcement

| Feature / Task | Status | Details & Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.B.1: Implement `get_session_briefing` IPC** | **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** | The IPC command is implemented, and `build_session_briefing` successfully constructs the `[SESSION CONTEXT]` block, dynamically including `exchange_count` and `total_errors` (e.g., "Exchange Count: 5/10"). **Remaining Gap:** The briefing logic does not yet check for and incorporate file metrics like **File Change Volume (>70%)** or **Patch Count (8+)** to suggest format changes (e.g., "Mandatory WHOLE FILE"). |
| **2.B.2: Integrate Functional Error Template** | **✅ COMPLETE** | The standard `[ACTION TEMPLATE]` (`Goal: <...>`, `Evidence: \n\n`) is successfully included in the briefing output. |
| **2.B.3: Implement `refresh_session` IPC** | **✅ COMPLETE (Core Logic)** | `refresh_session_logic` is implemented and correctly resets the `exchange_count` to 0 and updates the timestamp. Verified by test `c7`. |
| **2.B.4: Wire Threshold Enforcement** | **✅ COMPLETE (Blocking Logic)** | The `window.enforceThresholds` function in `ui-helpers.js` reads metrics and successfully **blocks input to the patch area** when `total_errors \ge 3` or `exchange_count \ge 10`. Verified by tests `c5` and `c6`. |

### PHASE 3 — Advanced Drift Guardrails & Polish (v0.4.0+)

The team is currently positioned to begin the final phase, which focuses on deepening the application's intelligence and resilience capabilities.

| Feature / Task | Status | Remaining Tasks (Focus for Next Steps) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1: Automatic Drift Enforcement** | **ESTABLISHED** | The explicit warning **`!! DRIFT LIKELY - HIGH ERROR COUNT !!`** is already being inserted into the briefing when `total_errors >= 3`. |
| **3.2: Session Archiving** | **PENDING** | The `refresh_session` logic needs to be extended to handle archiving the session state before resetting the exchange count. |
| **3.3: Reframe History UI** | **PENDING** | The UI components (`HistoryPanel.js`) are acknowledged as placeholders and need to be integrated to display past **Consolidation Points**. |
| **3.4: Ambiguity Feedback Injection** | **PENDING** | When `apply_patch_logic` encounters `ErrorCode::AmbiguousMatch`, the error message returned must be augmented to explicitly advise the AI to **increase surrounding context lines** (e.g., "Add MORE surrounding context lines (try 5-7)"). This is a critical guardrail against production failure modes. |
| **Dynamic Guidance Implementation (Metrics)** | **CRITICAL GAP** | We must integrate logic to read `file_metrics.patch_count` and `percent_changed` and use the defined thresholds (8+ patches, >70% change) to modify the briefing's instruction, guiding the AI toward the appropriate **Tiered Repair Strategy** (e.g., forcing a WHOLE FILE replacement). |
